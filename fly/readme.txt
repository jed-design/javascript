This micro app fetches widges from Holfuy.com and arrange them in a nice pattern, adapted for desktop or phone. 

It has no control over the actual widgets, but can use cutom background images. See folder "images" for the picture I use. 

It is pretty straigth forward. The info for the weather stations is stored early in the page as an array.  (number of the station, name of the station and link to a webcamera, if there is any.

At the bottom, there is a link to a norwegian site for weather forcasts for a lot of flying sites, most ly norway. 

The design is made to be fast loading and easy to read, also on phones, in sun light. 

Per today (2021-05-15) there is a version of the site up here: http://jed-design.com/fly.htm

Share, and enjoy!
